As a Low Voltage Construction Project Manager, I have successfully managed the installation and integration of advanced low voltage systems across a wide array of senior housing facilities, ranging from independent living communities to end-of-life care centers. My expertise spans a broad range of services, including CATV, CCTV, voice and data systems, fiber optics, access control, intercoms, and nurse call systems. Each project requires a unique approach, as I ensure that every system is tailored to meet the specific needs of residents while complying with safety regulations and enhancing the overall quality of care.

I have worked on buildings that serve diverse levels of care, understanding the importance of creating environments that are both safe and comfortable for seniors. In independent living facilities, I focus on providing reliable communication systems and entertainment options, while in skilled nursing and end-of-life care buildings, my work emphasizes critical connectivity, security, and emergency response capabilities. By collaborating with architects, engineers, and other stakeholders, I ensure that all systems are seamlessly integrated, functional, and supportive of the residentsâ€™ well-being, creating environments that promote safety, independence, and peace of mind for both residents and staff.
