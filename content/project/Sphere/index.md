### Overview  
As a Network Infrastructure Project Manager for the groundbreaking Las Vegas Sphere, I led the design, implementation, and management of the critical network systems that support this innovative venue. With a strong focus on scalability, security, and cutting-edge technology, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless connectivity and reliability for this state-of-the-art entertainment hub. My experience includes overseeing complex network installations, managing vendor relationships, and ensuring the successful integration of systems that support everything from high-speed data transfer to immersive audiovisual experiences. This project stands as a testament to my expertise in large-scale infrastructure management and my commitment to delivering solutions that meet the unique needs of modern entertainment environments.
