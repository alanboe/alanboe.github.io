<!-- I am a Master’s student specializing in robot cognition at the [Minnesota Robotics Institute (MnRI) at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/mnri). My journey in engineering began with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the same institution, where I built a strong foundation in engineering principles and problem-solving.

After earning my undergraduate degree, I immediately pursued my passion for robotics by enrolling in the Master’s program. This passion took root during a senior-year robotics course, where I had the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies like TensorFlow and UR5 robots. The timing was serendipitous—it coincided with the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. Witnessing the transformative potential of these technologies firsthand not only sparked my interest in advanced robotics but also solidified my decision to specialize in this field.

My academic focus lies at the intersection of robot perception, intelligence, and manipulation. I am particularly fascinated by how robots can interpret their environments, make intelligent decisions, and perform intricate manipulation tasks. As I advance through my Master’s program, I am driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to contribute meaningfully to the rapidly evolving field of robot cognition. -->
